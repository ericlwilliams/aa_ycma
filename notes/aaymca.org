*** better Rscript [script] 2>&1 | tee [logfile] (sends to stdout)
** number of rows: 487686
** Columns
*** mem_id, min_family, chi_date, exp_data, mtp_mty_period, type, mem_desc, mem_state

** TODO and questions
*** 109738 - first entry in raw isn't in cleaned (bc first line?)
*** Old entries unreliable? -> throw out before 2000?
**** First entries for series in 2000s often start with old dated entry, can't throw out
**** TODO plot mem_id vs earliest date!
*** 2003 sometimes appears as 1993 (same for others?)
*** Something up with 1994 (mostly 'New' with no fu), 11/28/94 ?
*** Maybe CHI_DATE on 'New' is worthless?
**** Not always earliest or entered
*** Clean up mtp_mty_period (should be 4 chars)
*** Each entry is a payment?
*** mtp_mty_period doesn't always make sense (e.g. earlier year than chi_dates [144652])
**** might correspond to financial year that is 'active'?
*** "New" can signify change in type (e.g. Youth->Teen)?
